This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 7.85 and an absolute frequency of 3. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 3.82 and an absolute frequency of 25. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 21 ; absolute frequency: 0.9774261112404. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 25 ; absolute frequency: 3.82438427413186. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 7.85340314136126. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
