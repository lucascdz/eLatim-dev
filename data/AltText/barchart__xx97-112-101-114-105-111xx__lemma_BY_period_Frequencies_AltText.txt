This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 4.49 and an absolute frequency of 2. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 1.12 and an absolute frequency of 24. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 24 ; absolute frequency: 1.11705841284617. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 6 ; absolute frequency: 0.917852225791647. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 4.49337227589306
