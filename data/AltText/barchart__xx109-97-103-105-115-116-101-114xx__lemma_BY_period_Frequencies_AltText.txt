This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 6.74 and an absolute frequency of 3. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 0.42 and an absolute frequency of 9. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 9 ; absolute frequency: 0.418896904817314. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 0.305950741930549. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 6.74005841383959
