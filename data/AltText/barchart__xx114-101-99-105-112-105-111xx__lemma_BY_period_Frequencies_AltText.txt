This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 4.75 and an absolute frequency of 102. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 4.75 and an absolute frequency of 102. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 102 ; absolute frequency: 4.74749825459623. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 25 ; absolute frequency: 3.82438427413186. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 1 ; absolute frequency: 2.24668613794653
