This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 3.37 and an absolute frequency of 22. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 1.07 and an absolute frequency of 23. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 23 ; absolute frequency: 1.07051431231091. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 22 ; absolute frequency: 3.36545816123604. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
