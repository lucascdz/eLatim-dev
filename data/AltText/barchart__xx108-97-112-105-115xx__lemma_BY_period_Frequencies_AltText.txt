This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 2.25 and an absolute frequency of 1. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 1.38 and an absolute frequency of 9. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 12 ; absolute frequency: 0.558529206423086. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 9 ; absolute frequency: 1.37677833868747. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 1 ; absolute frequency: 2.24668613794653
